2021 saw a virtual celebration due to the global pandemic. However, the Venice Carnival returns to its traditional festivity this year. Known for its vibrant and multifarious masks and costumes, the Venice Carnival is one of the oldest festivals worldwide. It is celebrated annually, beginning around two weeks before the Catholic season of Lent and ending on Shrove Tuesday or the day before Ash Wednesday.

 

The word "carnival", is said to have originated from the Latin words caro or carn, which means meat, and levare, which means put away.

Originally referred to the farewell banquet for meat, which was celebrated on the evening before Ash Wednesday. The origin of "carnival" can be linked to the Catholic's steadfast tradition of abstaining from meat during the Lenten season.



Aside from the deep meaning behind its name, the Venice Carnival has a fascinating history. The first occurrence of the carnival dates back to the year 1162 when the Republic of Venice won against Aquileia, ruled by Ulrich II von Treven. The citizens gathered and danced around Piazza San Marco to celebrate the victory. Ulrich was compensated for his defeat, having to pay a bull and twelve pigs to the Republic every Fat Thursday or the Thursday before Lent. The bull and pigs were then slaughtered at the Piazza San Marco for feasts and banquets.

Time went on, and the carnival changed drastically. No more bulls and pigs were slaughtered as Ulrich had already died then. Masks came into play, and by the 18th century, the celebration became one of the most famous in Europe. However, on October 17, 1797, Napoleon Bonaparte signed the Treaty of Campo Formio, which marked the end of the Republic of Venice. The Holy Roman Empire then controlled Venice, abolishing the carnival's celebration and banning the use of masks. Despite this, the carnival continued slowly throughout the 19th century as private celebrations. It was only until 1979 when the carnival was finally revived when the Republic of Italy chose to bring back Venice's old heritage and cultures. Ever since then, the carnival became a stunning tradition, and it has been so until now.



Today, the Venice Carnival is one of Veniceâ€™s most iconic festivals, being recognized worldwide. It astonishes the world with its intricate displays of masks and costumes across the streets and fun celebrations all across the streets of Venice. Despite a virtual celebration last year, the carnival reopens to physical celebrations this year as the pandemic becomes less worrying. One can only imagine how creative and extravagant humans can be by simple festivals that will never cease to entertain those who celebrate them.
